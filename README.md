Archimedes knew that he had not found the value of π but only an approximation. In this way, Archimedes showed that π is between 3 1/7 and 3 10/71. 

Mathematicians began using the Greek letter π in the 1700s. Introduced by William Jones in 1706, use of the symbol was popularized by Leonhard Euler, who adopted it in 1737. 

Today it is interesting to know that, some computer programmers have calculated the value of pi to more than 22 trillion digits. 

In this programm i am interested in computing the distribution of the number of times different digits appear in the first 10 millions digits of pi.

I then compare the results with a program that computes the distribution of random 0-9 digit by means of a random number generator (RNG). The RNG is using JAVA linear congruential formula.

The results show that Pi is not what we call a truly random number.
